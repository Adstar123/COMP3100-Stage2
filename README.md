# Running the script
Type the following into the terminal: "python3 ./s2_test.py "java MyClientA2" -n -r results/ref_results.json"

This should start the script. It make take some time to complete. This uses the ref_results.json file as refrence for how well my script does. If you do want to calculate that using the script run the following command instead: "python3 ./s2_test.py "java MyClientA2" -n -c S2TestConfigs"
